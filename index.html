                <h1>Work Experience</h1>
                <p>I started my career with a couple of entry level IT jobs. While I enjoyed my time with IT, I always knew that my passion was in programming. In June 2021, I started an internship with CSC as a technical engineer. After 2 great months with the Architecture and Engineering team, my internship came to a close. The people at CSC loved my work ethic and enthusiasm, and I was offered a full time job on the automation team! </p>

                <h1>Education</h1>
                <p>I started school at The University of South Carolina in August 2016. I majored in Computer Science and found myself on the Dean's list twice! Finally, I graduated in August 2020. Thanks to good 'ol Coronavirus, my graduation was virtual.</p>

                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>I grew up in Wilmington, Delaware and have always loved it here. It was nice to get away for 4 years during college, but I found myself always missing my little home state. I am glad that I now have a full time job in Delaware and can continue living life here with my family and friends!</p>
